- linking against native libraries
  - os-specific linker arguments
- rust interop is easy!
  - but ocaml5 doesn't work (yet)
  - dune sourcetree ignores directories begining with "." and every rust project will need a .config directory to be released with opam
- inline testing
- loading a wav file with mm
  - easier to do this in rust
  - ocaml-rs float32 arrays are broken
- opam install and opam pin don't handle local packages in some cases

post starts here:

I recently made my first non-trivial OCaml project - a synthesizer library
called [llama](https://github.com/gridbugs/llama/). It's made up of multiple
Opam packages, it links against native code, it calls into code in a foreign
language (Rust), it's (somewhat!) documented, it works on MacOS and Linux, it's
released to the Opam repository. Non-trivial! The language ecosystem I've spent the most time
in is Rust/Cargo and as such I'm accustomed to things "just working". This is a
post about the times while developing my library that I was surprised or
confused or frustrated by something in the OCaml ecosystem that didn't "just work".

## Linking Against Native Libraries

My library makes noise by sending samples to the sound card
via a small Rust library that uses
[cpal](https://crates.io/crates/cpal) to talk to the audio driver and
[ocaml-rs](https://crates.io/crates/ocaml) for OCaml interop. The Rust code is compiled to an archive
`liblow_level.a` and I set up the dune project for the library based on
[`ocaml-rs`'s docs](https://zshipko.github.io/ocaml-rs/).

My dune file looked like this:
```clojure
(library
 (name llama_low_level)
 (foreign_archives low_level)
 (c_library_flags
  (-lpthread -lc -lm)))
```

Trying to build this:
```
$ dune build
...
Error: No rule found for dlllow_level.so
```

I only have a static archive (.a) of the Rust library - not a shared object (.so)
file. Searching the [dune (library ...) stanza
documentation](https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/dune-files.html#library)
for the word "dynamic" I found:

> `(no_dynlink)` disables dynamic linking of the library. This is for advanced use
> only. By default, you shouldnâ€™t set this option.

A bit of a scary looking message - my use case doesn't seem too advanced. Adding `(no_dynlink)` does seem to fix the problem:

```clojure
(library
 (name llama_low_level)
 (no_dynlink)
 (foreign_archives low_level)
 (c_library_flags
  (-lpthread -lc -lm)))
```

Next I made a small executable to test calling a function in the
`llama_low_level` library:

```clojure
(executable
 (public_name experiment)
 (libraries llama_low_level))
```

Building this caused my terminal to fill with errors. Here's the start of the
long error message:
```
$ dune build
File "bin/dune", line 2, characters 14-24:
2 |  (public_name experiment)
                  ^^^^^^^^^^
Undefined symbols for architecture arm64:
  "_AudioComponentFindNext", referenced from:
      cpal::host::coreaudio::macos::audio_unit_from_device::h062e0db473d1abd3 in liblow_level.a(low_level-0e968d755c3460c1.low_level.2e2e0021-cgu.6.rcgu.o)
```

Searching for "AudioComponentFindNext" led me to some Apple developer docs for
the `AudioToolbox` framework. So the foreign archive must depend on some frameworks
on MacOS for doing "audio stuff" and I need to tell the linker about it.
Eventually I found the appropriate linker flags on stack overflow to copy/paste
into my project:

```
-framework CoreServices -framework CoreAudio -framework AudioUnit -framework AudioToolbox
```

But what do I have to _do_ with these flags? If I was compiling a C program I
could pass them to the linker via `clang`:
```
clang foo.c -Wl,-framework,CoreServices,-framework,CoreAudio,-framework,AudioUnit,-framework,AudioToolbox
```

The `-Wl` flag tells clang to pass its argument to the linker. I need to find out how to do this in dune/OCaml.

Reading through `dune`'s library docs again and there's this field:
> `(library_flags (<flags>))` is a list of flags passed to ocamlc and ocamlopt
> when building the library archive files.

Sounds promising. Now I need a way to get `ocamlc` to pass custom flags to the
linker. `man ocamlc` gives two condenders:

> -cclib -llibname
>
> Pass the -llibname option to the C linker when linking in "custom runtime"
> mode  (see  the  -custom  option).  This  causes the given C library to be
>linked with the program.
>
> -ccopt option
>
> Pass the given option to the C compiler and linker, when linking in  "custom  runtime"  mode  (see  the -custom option). For instance, -ccopt -Ldir
> causes the C linker to search for C libraries in directory dir.


Putting these together:
```clojure
(library
 (name llama_low_level)
 (no_dynlink)
 (foreign_archives low_level)
 (c_library_flags
  (-lpthread -lc -lm))
 (library_flags
  (-ccopt -framework -ccopt CoreServices -ccopt -framework -ccopt CoreAudio -ccopt -framework -ccopt AudioUnit -ccopt -framework -ccopt AudioToolbox)))
```

Both `-ccopt` and `-cclib` can be used interchangeably in that example and they
seem to work. The docs for `-cclib` suggest that it's only for passing library
names but it's not documented what happens if you pass it something other than
`-llibname`.

I later found out that you can avoid passing `-ccopt` before each linker
argument by putting the linker arguments in quotes:

```clojure
(library_flags
 (-ccopt "-framework CoreServices -framework CoreAudio -framework AudioUnit -framework AudioToolbox))
```

Now it builds!

But only on MacOS.

On Linux the appropriate linker incantation is `-lasound` if you're lucky and
the linker knows where to look for the `libasound.so` library. In general though
the linker arguments are the output of running:
```
$ pkg-config --libs alsa
```
On my Linux (NixOS) computer this is:
```
-L/nix/store/qnf36msgsjh17sy9dakvqnvv7sgr8dfg-alsa-lib-1.2.9/lib -lasound
```

Keen-eyed readers will have noticed that `libasound.so` is a dynamic library and
might be wondering why this works despite setting `(no_dynlink)` in the dune
file. I take the fact this this does work to mean that when the docs for
`(no_dynlink)` say "disables dynamic linking of the library", they are just
referring to how the OCaml library links against the libraries listed in
`(foreign archives ...)` (for us this is just "low_level") - not libraries
explicitly passed to the linker (such as `asound`).

On Linux I need to generate the linker flags from a command rather than
hard-coding them in the dune file. The only way to do this in dune is to
generate a text file containing an [S-expression
(sexp)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression) representation of a list of
arguments and then using dune's `:include` keyword to load a list of arguments
from the file.

So I need to generate a file with the following contexts:
```clojure
("-cclib" "-L/nix/store/qnf36msgsjh17sy9dakvqnvv7sgr8dfg-alsa-lib-1.2.9/lib -lasound")
```
Note the opening and closing parentheses. These are required as the file must
contain a sexp. Also this time around we do have to pass `-cclib` as `-ccopt`
doesn't work. I guess because we are passing the name of a library to link
against?

To generate this file we can use a dune rule:
```clojure
(rule
 (action
  (with-stdout-to
   library_flags.sexp
   (progn
    (echo "(\"-cclib\" \"")
    (bash "pkg-config --libs alsa")
    (echo "\")")))))

(library
 (name llama_low_level)
 (no_dynlink)
 (foreign_archives low_level)
 (c_library_flags
  (-lpthread -lc -lm))
 (library_flags
  (:include library_flags.sexp)))
```

This works on Linux but of course now it won't build on MacOS as we removed the
MacOS-specific linker flags and replaced them with the Linux ones. To work in
general (well just on MacOS and Linux) we can use dune's `(enabled_if ...)`
field to use a different rule to generate `library_flags.sexp` on MacOS.

```clojure
(rule
 (enabled_if
  (= %{system} macosx))
 (action
  (write-file
   library_flags.sexp
   "(\"-ccopt\" \"-framework CoreServices -framework CoreAudio -framework AudioUnit -framework AudioToolbox\")")))

(rule
 (enabled_if
  (= %{system} linux))
 (action
  (with-stdout-to
   library_flags.sexp
   (progn
    (echo "(\"-cclib\" \"")
    (bash "pkg-config --libs alsa")
    (echo "\")")))))

(rule
 (enabled_if
  (and
   (<> %{system} macosx)
   (<> %{system} linux)))
 (action
  (write-file library_flags.sexp "()")))

(library
 (name llama_low_level)
 (no_dynlink)
 (foreign_archives low_level)
 (c_library_flags
  (-lpthread -lc -lm))
 (library_flags
  (:include library_flags.sexp)))
```
Note that the system name for MacOS is "macosx". There's an "x" at the end.
Don't forget the "x" or the comparison will always be false.

Also note the third rule which creates an empty sexp file in the case that the
system is neither Linux nor MacOS. This is so that if someone deigns to build
this on a non-Linux non-MacOS system they don't get an error about the
`library_flags.sexp` file being missing (instead they will probably get some
sort of linker error).

This is all a bit of a mess. It's awkward to construct sexp files by manually
adding parentheses around the output of commands and adding the right level of
escaping quotes, and the catch-all rule for non-Linux non-MacOS systems has to
repeat the `enabled_if` conditions from the previous rules in its negation of
them.

Generating sexp files is difficult in dune files but it's the only way to
dynamically pass arguments to the linker (and to do a bunch of other operations
that require dynamic input). The recommended way to probe the current system
is not to do it from a dune file but instead write an OCaml program to do it.
There's a helper library for this purpose:
[dune-configurator](https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/dune-configurator).

Here's the OCaml program that generates `library_flags.sexp`:
```ocaml
module C = Configurator.V1

let macos_library_flags =
  let frameworks =
    [ "CoreServices"; "CoreAudio"; "CoreMidi"; "AudioUnit"; "AudioToolbox" ]
  in
  List.map (Printf.sprintf "-framework %s") frameworks

let () =
  C.main ~name:"llama_low_level" (fun c ->
      let linker_args =
        match C.ocaml_config_var_exn c "system" with
        | "macosx" -> macos_library_flags
        | "linux" -> (
            let default = [ "-lasound" ] in
            match C.Pkg_config.get c with
            | None -> default
            | Some pc -> (
                match C.Pkg_config.query pc ~package:"alsa" with
                | None -> default
                | Some conf -> conf.libs))
        | _ -> []
      in
      let cclib_arg = String.concat " " linker_args in
      C.Flags.write_sexp "library_flags.sexp" [ "-cclib"; cclib_arg ])
```

This goes into a file `discover.ml` in a separate directory from the `low_level`
library's files, and it's got a dune file which just builds an executable:
```clojure
(executable
 (name discover)
 (libraries dune-configurator))
```

Now the dune file for `low_level` can run `discover.exe` in a single rule rather
than having a separate rule for each system:
```clojure
(rule
 (target library_flags.sexp)
 (action
  (run ./config/discover.exe)))

(library
 (name llama_low_level)
 (no_dynlink)
 (foreign_archives low_level)
 (c_library_flags
  (-lpthread -lc -lm))
 (library_flags
  (:include library_flags.sexp)))
```

## Rust Interoperability

Rust interoperability is easier than I expected! The crate (Rust library)
[ocaml-rs](https://crates.io/crates/ocaml) defines some annotations you can
attach to functions to expose them in a way that's compatible with OCaml's `external` syntax.

In Rust you write:
```rust
#[ocaml::func]
pub fn send_sample(mut t: ocaml::Pointer<OutputStreamOcaml>, sample: f32) {
    let output_stream = t.as_mut();
    output_stream.send_sample(sample);
}
```
...and then in OCaml you can write:
```ocaml
external send_sample : t -> float -> unit = "send_sample"
```

You can even get dune to build your cargo project for you:
```clojure
(rule
 (target liblow_level.a)
 (deps
  (source_tree low-level-rust))
 (action
  (progn
   (chdir
    low-level-rust
    (run cargo build --release))
   (run mv low-level-rust/target/release/%{target} %{target}))))
```

This rule creates the `liblow_level.a` file that was used in the previous
section. The `low-level-rust` directory in the `(source_tree low-level-rust)`
contains a regular old cargo project (ie. it has a `Cargo.toml` file and a
`src` directory containing Rust code).

There's lots more information about interoperability between OCaml and Rust in
the [ocaml-rs book](https://zshipko.github.io/ocaml-rs/).

I intended to release my library on Opam and one caveat of releasing packages
with a Rust component to Opam is that the sandbox environment used to build Opam
packages does not have internet access, and building a Rust project typically
involves downloading dependencies. To get around this, the source tarball
refered to in the Opam package's manifest must already include all the Rust code
needed to build the project. Setting this up is easy - run `cargo vendor` in the
Rust project to create a `vendor` directory containing the code for all the
project's dependencies. The command also prints some instructions for building
with the vendored code:

```
To use vendored sources, add this to your .cargo/config.toml for this project:

[source.crates-io]
replace-with = "vendored-sources"

[source.vendored-sources]
directory = "vendor"
```

So I went ahead and created the file low-level-rust/.cargo/config.toml after
vendoring all my dependencies, and to make sure that no dependencies were being
clandestinely downloaded I replaced `run cargo build --release` with
`run cargo build --release --offline` in the dune file, and also removed all my
cached cargo packages by running `cargo cache --remove-dir all`.

```

```

Hey what gives?

The `cpal` library has been vendored and its source code has made its way to the
`_build` directory:
```
 $ ls _build/default/src/low-level/low-level-rust/vendor/cpal/
examples  CHANGELOG.md  Cargo.toml  Dockerfile  README.md
src       Cargo.lock    Cross.toml  LICENSE     build.rs
```

And yet cargo cannot see it.

Fifteen or so minutes of confusion turned to disappointment when I learnt
through trial and error that the `.cargo` directory wasn't being copied because
`(source_tree ...)` silently ignores files and directories whose names begin
with a ".". This meant that cargo didn't know to look in the `vendor` directory
for packages. If you've been bitten by this and found this page by searching "dune
ignores hidden files" then feel free to share your story at the github issue:
[Hidden folders are ignored in source_tree
dep](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/issues/7135). I fixed the problem by renaming
the directory to `dot_cargo`. Don't be tempted to name it `_cargo` as
`source_tree` also ignores files whose names begin with a "_". Some helpful
advice from the aforementioned github issue was to explicitly tell dune about
the `.cargo` directory in a dune file. Combined with suggestions from the
ocaml-rs book, the dune file in the Rust project (next to `Cargo.toml`) is:
```clojure
(dirs :standard .cargo \ target)
(data_only_dirs vendor)
```

These files are ignored by default to prevent dune from accidentally copying
`.git` or `_build` into the `_build` directory, but this feels like a case of a
tool trying to be helpful by making assumptions that turn into surprising
behaviour when the assumptions don't hold. These types of problems tend to be
hard to debug as the symptoms of the problem are far removed from the source of
the problem (cargo couldn't find a dependency because I put its configuration in
a directory whose named started with a "."). In addition it's often hard to find
documentation or advice online for this reason. It wasn't obvious that this was
a quirk of `(source_tree ...)` so I didn't know to check its documentation and
even if I did, at the time of writing its documentation just says:

> (`source_tree <dir>)` depends on all source files in the subtree with root `<dir>`.

The actual place I should have looked is in the [documentation for `(dirs
...)`](https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/dune-files.html#dirs):

> The `dirs` stanza allows specifying the subdirectories Dune will include in a
> build. The syntax is based on Duneâ€™s Predicate Language and allows the
> following operations:

> - The special value `:standard` which refers to the default set of used
>   directories. These are the directories that donâ€™t start with `.` or `_`.

I find this UX anti-pattern to be pervasive in the OCaml tooling ecosystem
which I think is why so often I'm surprised by something one of our tools does
and why our tools tend to fail in complex, difficult to understand ways. There
are so many special cases aimed to be helpful but when a special case fails and
prevents me from doing something that should be simple I wish that the tools
were dumber and failed in simpler ways which were easy to understand and fix or
workaround.

If I got to name this pattern I would call it "Jar Jar-ing". In the Star Wars
prequel trilogy Jar Jar Binks is always eager to help but his attempts usually
backfire in ways that make the situation worse. It's also a play on the word
"jarring". You get it.

But I digress.

## Adventures Trying to Read a .wav File

I wanted the ability to load and play .wav files in my synthesizer library. I'd
been interested in checking out the
[ocaml-mm](https://github.com/savonet/ocaml-mm) multimedia library for a while
and this seemed like a good time. I got my hands on some old-school drum samples
that I wanted to use for my synth, and made a little program that used `mm` to
read a .wav file:
```ocaml
let () =
  let wav_file = new Mm.Audio.IO.Reader.of_wav_file "./cymbal.wav" in
  let sample_rate = wav_file#sample_rate in
  print_endline (Printf.sprintf "sample_rate: %d" sample_rate)
```
This prints out `sample_rate: 44100`. We're off to a good start.

Let's try reading some audio samples from the file:
```ocaml
let () =
  let wav_file = new Mm.Audio.IO.Reader.of_wav_file "./cymbal.wav" in
  let buffer = Mm.Audio.create 2 10000
  let _ = wav_file#read buffer 0 1 in
  ()
```
Running this:
```
Fatal error: exception File "src/audio.ml", line 1892, characters 21-27: Assertion failed
```

Less promising, but maybe I screwed up the indexes or something. Let's check
which assertion failed:
```ocaml
match sample_size with
  | 16 -> S16LE.to_audio sbuf 0 buf ofs len
  | 8 -> U8.to_audio sbuf 0 buf ofs len
  | _ -> assert false
```

My wav file uses 24-bit samples but I probably can't hear the difference between
24-bit and 16-bit drum sounds so I used `ffmpeg` to downsample my .wav to
16-bit:
```
$ ffmpeg -i cymbal.wav -af "aformat=s16:sample_rates=44100" cymbal-16bit.wav
```

And make sure that it worked:
```
$ file cymbal-16bit.wav
cymbal-16bit.wav: RIFF (little-endian) data, WAVE audio, Microsoft PCM, 16 bit, mono 44100 Hz
```

And updated the code to load the new 16-bit .wav file, and its output was:
```
Fatal error: exception Mm_audio.Audio.IO.Invalid_file
```

So I gave up and switched to Rust.

Just kidding.

But I did use the [hound](https://crates.io/crates/hound) Rust library to load
.wav files. I'd already gone to the effort of getting Rust interoperability
working to get access to the `cpal` library for talking to the audio driver so
it was very easy to add an additional Rust dependency and write a little wrapper that
reads a .wav file and copies the contained audio samples into an OCaml array.

The first thing I did when I started this project was getting the Rust
interoperability working as it's necessary to actually make sound at all via the
`cpal` library. A nice unintended consequence was that when I couldn't find a
high-quality OCaml library to load .wav files I could just use a Rust library
instead. It's no secret that there are far more people writing Rust libraries
than OCaml libraries but since OCaml/Rust interop is so easy, we can just fill
in any gaps in our library ecosystem with Rust libraries until our own libraries
are up to scratch.

I ran into an interesting bug while copying audio samples into an OCaml array.
Currently if you have a Rust function that returns an array of 32-bit floats:
```rust
#[ocaml::func]
pub fn make_float_array() -> Vec<f32> {
    vec![0.0, 1.0, 2.0]
}
```
...and you refer to it in OCaml:
```ocaml
external make_float_array : unit -> float array = "make_float_array"
```
...when you call the function in OCaml you get an array whose iteration
behaviour works as expected, but indexing it with `Array.get` always returns
`0.0`. In some cases arrays of floats in OCaml are represented in a special
format but `ocaml-rs` was only converting 64-bit floats into this format. At the
time of writing I have an open PR to fix this bug.
